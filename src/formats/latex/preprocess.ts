/**
 * LaTeX input preprocessing — `Latex::Parser#pre_processing`
 * (`lib/plurimath/latex/parser.rb:25-40`), ported together with the offset
 * bookkeeping the gem does not need.
 *
 * The gem:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * def pre_processing(text)
 *   text_functions = text.scan(TEXT_REGEX)
 *   text = @enti.encode(@enti.decode(text), :hexadecimal)
 *   text = gsub_space_and_unicodes(text)
 *   text.gsub(TEXT_REGEX) { |_str| text_functions.shift }
 * end
 *
 * def gsub_space_and_unicodes(text)
 *   text
 *     .gsub(/((?<!\\) )|\n+/, "")
 *     .gsub("\\\\ ", "\\\\\\\\")
 *     .gsub("&#x26;", "&")
 *     .gsub("&#x22;", "\"")
 *     .gsub(/(?<!\\\\)\\&#xa;/, "\\ ")
 *     .gsub("&#xa;", "")
 * end
 * ```
 *
 * It runs in `initialize` (`:12`), so `Latex::Parser#text` is already
 * normalised before `parse` is called — which is why the grammar's
 * `decimal_marker` matches an ENTITY-ENCODED marker (`grammar.ts`), and why the
 * corpus records a `preprocessed` field at all.
 *
 * ## What it does, in one line
 *
 * Decode every entity to its character, re-encode everything outside printable
 * ASCII (plus `<>'"&`) to a HEX entity, drop unescaped spaces, then undo five
 * specific encodings. Net effect: named and decimal entities are normalised to
 * hex, `&amp;`/`&quot;` come back as bare characters, newlines vanish, and
 * `\text{...}`/`\mbox{...}` bodies are exempted from all of it.
 *
 * ## The three Ruby traps this file exists to not fall into
 *
 * 1. **`gsub`'s replacement string processes backslashes.** `.gsub("\\\\ ",
 *    "\\\\\\\\")` is a 2-backslash-plus-space pattern and a FOUR-backslash
 *    replacement string, and Ruby turns each `\\` into one backslash — so the
 *    result is TWO backslashes, not four. A literal transcription into
 *    `String.prototype.replace` emits four and destroys the LaTeX linebreak
 *    token. Every pass here uses a function replacer, which has no such
 *    processing in either language, and the replacement text is written out
 *    directly.
 * 2. **`\` followed by a space is not an escape.** The replacement `"\\ "` at
 *    `parser.rb:38` is backslash-space and survives verbatim — the opposite
 *    direction of the same trap.
 * 3. **Ruby's `[^\u{20}-\u{7E}]` matches CODE POINTS.** An astral character is
 *    one match and encodes to one entity. The encoder here iterates by code
 *    point for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Offsets
 *
 * Almost every pass changes lengths, so an offset into the preprocessed text
 * does not index the caller's input. Every position that reaches a user —
 * `ParseError.index` above all — goes through the returned `SourceMap` first
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md §5, §7). Offsets are UTF-16 code units end to end, matching
 * pegkit's contract; spans are tracked per code unit, so a surrogate pair keeps
 * an exact mapping for both halves.
