/**
 * UnicodeMath input preprocessing — `UnicodeMath::Parser#initialize` and
 * `#pre_processing` (`lib/plurimath/unicode_math/parser.rb:10-22, 43-53`),
 * ported together with the offset bookkeeping the gem does not need.
 *
 * The gem, in the order it runs:
 *
 * ```ruby
 * def initialize(text)
 *   text = pre_processing(text)                                    # :11
 *   @text = ::HTMLEntities.new.encode(text, :hexadecimal)          # :12
 *   @text = @text.gsub("&#x26;", "&")                              # :13
 *   @text = @text.gsub("&#x22;", "\"")                             # :14
 *   @text = @text.gsub(/&#x2af7;.*&#x2af8;/, "")                   # :15
 *   @text = @text.gsub("\\\\", "\\")                               # :16
 *   @text = @text.gsub(/\\u([\da-fA-F]{1,5})\w{0,5}/) do           # :17-20
 *     "&#x#{$1};"
 *   end
 *   @text = @text.strip                                            # :21
 * end
 *
 * def pre_processing(text)
 *   text unless text.include?("#") && !text.match?(LABELED_TR_REGEX)  # :44
 *   text = text.gsub(/✎\(.*(\#).*\)/) do |str|                        # :46-48
 *     str.gsub("#", "\"replacement\"")
 *   end
 *   splitted = text.split("#")                                        # :49
 *   splitted[0] = splitted.first.gsub("\"replacement\"", "#")         # :50
 *   @splitted = splitted.last if splitted.count > 1                   # :51
 *   splitted.first                                                    # :52
 * end
 * ```
 *
 * It runs in the CONSTRUCTOR, so `UnicodeMath::Parser#text` is already
 * normalised before `#parse` is called — which is why the grammar matches
 * ENTITY-ENCODED characters and why the fixture set records a `preprocessed`
 * field at all.
 *
 * ## What it does, in one line
 *
 * Cut the input at the first `#` (keeping the tail as an equation label),
 * hex-encode every character that is NOT printable ASCII, and the five
 * printable ones `<`, `>`, `'`, `"` and `&` as well, undo the `&` and `"`
 * encodings again, delete `⫷…⫸` spans, halve doubled backslashes, rewrite
 * `\uXXXX` escapes to hex entities, and strip.
 *
 * ## It is NOT LaTeX's, and the differences are load-bearing
 *
 * `latex/preprocess.ts` shares only the encoder. Measured differences:
 *
 *   - LaTeX encodes `@enti.encode(@enti.decode(text), :hexadecimal)`; this
 *     encodes with **no decode first**. So `"&amp;"` here becomes `"&#x26;amp;"`
 *     at `:12` and then `"&amp;"` again at `:13` — a round trip — where LaTeX
 *     would have decoded it to `"&"` first. Measured on the pinned clone:
 *     `Parser.new("&amp;").text == "&amp;"`.
 *   - LaTeX strips unescaped spaces (`/((?<!\\) )|\n+/`); UnicodeMath keeps
 *     every interior space and only `strip`s the ends. Measured:
 *     `Parser.new("2 π r").text == "2 &#x3c0; r"`.
 *   - The `#` split, the `⫷…⫸` deletion and the `\uXXXX` rewrite have no LaTeX
 *     counterpart at all.
 *
 * ## Offsets
 *
 * Almost every pass changes lengths, and the `#` split TRUNCATES, so an offset
 * into the preprocessed text does not index the caller's input. Every position
 * that reaches a user — `ParseError.index` above all — goes through the
 * returned `SourceMap` first.

/**
 * The encoder's two passes, and the character set they cover.
 *
 * Measured rather than transcribed: every code point in `0..0x2FFFF` (skipping

 * pinned clone with htmlentities 4.4.2. The code points left AS-IS came back as
 * exactly `0020-0021, 0023-0025, 0028-003b, 003d, 003f-007e` — that is, printable
 * ASCII minus `"`, `&`, `'`, `<` and `>`. Everything else encoded. The two
 * patterns below are precisely the complement of that set.
 *

 * ONE code point and therefore ONE entity (measured: `𝕒` → `"&#x1d552;"`),
 * which is why `ENCODE_EXTENDED` carries the `u` flag.
